# Project Atelier API

Project Atelier is a system design capstone. The goal was to replace the exisiting API (for [Project Atelier](https://github.com/rpp33-fec-green/FEC-Team-Green)) with a backend system that can support the full data set for the retailing website and can be scaled to meet the demands of production traffic. The original monolithic system was break into different pieces with my teammates (proudcts, reviews and QA), so each part of the service could be scaled accordingly.

## Project Overview:

The final architecture consits of a Nginx load balancer, three Node/Express servers and one PostgreSQL database. This API endpoint has been optimized and tuned to handle production level traffice (verified by loader.io stress test)

## Running Locally

1. Set up a local Postgres Database
```sh
# Install Postgress in the terminal
brew services start postgresql
#Log in 
psql postgres 
#create a new user 
CREATE ROLE root WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password'
#grant user access to create database 
ALTER ROLE root CREATEDB
#log in with new username
psql postgres  -U root
```
2. Excute script in a given path 
```sh
#excute script in a given path 
\i filepath
\i database/schema.sql
```
3. Set up the Node/Express server
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
## Performance Results: 

#### Performance Target
**Throughput:** 100RPS on EC2
**Error Rate:** (<1% under load)
**Latency:** < 2000ms

#### End Results(Last 10% of DB):
- [x] Throughput: ~4000 RPS (Max 5000RPS)
- [x] Latency: ~17ms
- [x] Error rate: 0%
